# Minecraft Log Dumps

## Introduction
**Minecraft Log Dumps**, formerly known as TotalFreedom Log Dumps, which was previously known as TF-Log-Dumps, is a project that is aimed to archive logs of various Minecraft servers by extracting logs from Minecraft client sessions.

## Where do they come from?
The logs come from installations of Minecraft that I've used over the years. Most of the time they're from backups of the past.
