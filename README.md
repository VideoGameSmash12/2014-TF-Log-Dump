# TotalFreedom Log Dumps

## Introduction
**TotalFreedom Log Dumps**, formerly known as TF-Log-Dumps, is a project that is aimed to archive logs of the TotalFreedom Minecraft server by extracting logs from Minecraft client sessions.

## Where do they come from?
The logs come from installations of Minecraft that I've used over the years. Most of the time they're from backups of the past.
