[18:17:52] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] UU - Head Builder < Snowy> Fly
[18:17:53] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] UU - Head Builder < Snowy> Or a warp

[18:18:13] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] UU - Head Builder < Snowy> I personally think a pit would be a good option
[18:18:15] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < Panther> They use sand/redstone
[18:18:21] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < Panther> But their one flow
[18:18:23] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < Panther> flaw*
[18:18:25] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [SA] <Admeda> Teleporter to get up?
[18:18:29] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] -=FiZh=- < ApplzGamerZ> warp?
[18:18:35] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < Panther> You can go up and log the blocks

[18:19:06] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <Ghostie> < Clod> so people could worldedit the whole spawn out
[18:19:11] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Admeda - Setting personal login message
[18:19:13] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < Vyk> elevator or warp teleporter
[18:19:22] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [SA] <Admeda> I think pit down and teleporter up
[18:19:22] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] UU - Head Builder < Snowy> Warp teleporter, and I see several ways it could work
[18:19:26] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] UU - Head Builder < Snowy> ...
[18:19:26] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < Vyk> ok
[18:19:27] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] UU - Head Builder < Snowy> mmm
